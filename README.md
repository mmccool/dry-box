# Supports for 3D Printing Dry Box
Supports for a rod to put inside a plastic box to hang 3D printing filament from.
The supports are designed for a 25mm rod.
There should also be holes in the side of the box to pass filament 
and some kind of moisture absorber,
either silicone beads or clay (e.g. cat litter).
